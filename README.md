# Confessions of A Crap Programmer

#### In homage to Philip K. Dick, here is a mandatory and much needed self-assessment with 6 weeks left in the Epicodus Classroom. 9.29.17

## Description

Here I am with 15 weeks of part-time intro and nine weeks of full-time Java and Javascript behind me and I am confronted by two feelings.  One: I have learned a lot, every day, and I literally speak new languages.
Two: There is an overwhelming gap between my knowledge and the knowledge I feel that I must possess to move forward in a career.

Today, I spent some time reading through the links and decided to set a goal to finish the UX Crash Course before the beginning of Android.  I read through the first three this morning (screenshots in the IMG folder).

I also read on the Pomodoro Method and followed it throughout the day.  I follow a similar pattern already, but to put some intention behind it felt great and the timer really kept me moving forward. I even got a bunch of discrete tasks accomplished around the house in those 5 minutes breaks, because I was forced to spend some time somewhere else.

I followed two security courses on Lynda today.  (Capture8.JPG is for the module I completed).  Here, in the security realm, I see the steepest climb ahead of me.  Beyond the specific lessons on using these tools and some syntax.  I need to work on some logic challenges to push ahead.



## Known Bugs
